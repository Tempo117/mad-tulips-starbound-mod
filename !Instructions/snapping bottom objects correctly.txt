1) get the height of the png from .frames file i.e.: <"size" : [117, 35]>
2) divide that number by 2 i.e.: 35/2 = 17.5
3) find the closest number that is to that result that is a multiple of 8 i.e. 17,5 -> 16
4) use minus that the number from step 3) as the top parts y offset i.e.: -16
5) substract the number from step 3) from the numer from step 1). i.e.: 35-16 = 19
6) use minus the number from step 5) for the bottom offset. i.e. -19

That boils down to this two facts:
-> top_offset + bottom_offset = -height of png in pixels.
-> top_offset = n*8 ; n is a natural number (1,2,3,4,...)
