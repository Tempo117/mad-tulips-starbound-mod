All work done on object and items.

New interface needs tags set.

Updated the the player.config file to .patch system. fro object and items.

Added recipes for all normal game items that relate to a ship. Based those 
recipe off of old ones still needs work on balancing.

 We have updated the glitch towers and engines to match the new style.
 
 Added Novakid engines, large ftl thruster, sectorairlock, shipdoor, small fin, stabiliztion thruster.
 
 Added large glitch engine thruster.
 
 Old doors are broken.
 
 I am not 100 percent but believe everything else but tech, tile sets and air systems 
 has been updated as I had removed them.
 
 Also removed references to module in a box. Needs re added.
 
 Updated many object files under ship parts may have them all updated.

 Recipes just need balanced. I fell they need some smoothing and some item need to be
 available earlier in the game.
 
 We should edit the quest to upgrade the ship to give parts to the player. What do you think?
 
 Also, we should upgrade the fuel capacity at higher tiers. What do you think?
 
 SO far from an object stand point that is what I have.
