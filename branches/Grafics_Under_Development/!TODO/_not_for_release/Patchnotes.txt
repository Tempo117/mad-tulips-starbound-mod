- initial teleporter is breakable now (need to start a new ship for that)
- new alternate tilesets for all races
- support for some additional races
- automatic gun turrets styles for each race
- all animated decorative gun turrets are not top and bottom placeable
- all our doors are now also placeable horizontal
- filled up all left standard ship objects like heat absorbers, comm stations, fins
- life support code speedup and support for horizontal doors
- shipstation gfx reworked

- Crew
- crafting station: Crew Console is craftable at tier2 with shipstation
- crafting station sells crew NPC spawners as well als a info and some promotion items
- crew spawner is to be placed on the ground and used (on your ship - wont work on planets (we do that later))
- promotion and info items are to be equiped and then the crew is to be used in order to take effect (we cant code interaction menue buttons yet)

- Crew behavior
What you currently see is the crew just hanging around doing theire thing. Inspired by dwarfen fortress we
will add more things the crew might do on the ship. We already wrote a quite large framework to support
such crew behavior and are currently working on pathfinding for that system (the vanilla pathfind is just bad as you noticed already)

So for now they have 2 phases of the day: rest and work
- during rest they seach for items that they can rest with/on. those would include:
- during work they search for items that fit theyre job
(i.e. a medic like to hang at a medical tube or table while a marine likes to hang near a weapons rack)

- you can chat with them for some prebuild sentences (if you feel writy send us some more :)
- they also chat with eachother, sit, sleep and whatnot to look busy.
