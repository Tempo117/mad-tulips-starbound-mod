I have given the alternate tileset idea a bit more thought, even changing the tiles didnt help me and i cant for the life of me get them to alighn FUcking soooooo frustrating
I really need help ...... and i still don't think that the aditional pieces should be a whole new set of blocks and what not 
i just wanted to take a simple screwdriver tool click on tile that was already set and cycle through a few options you know so that i have more options for building ships
