General

Ship Station
- icon in top left corner when opening ship station
- icons for the filters ( one or two left )
- replace the remaining button icons in shipstation folder with something useful

Metal press
-- upper left corner crafting menu icon needs to be created

- cost for all platings need to be thought about

- maybe not all variants of the platings will be needed for now we can just uncomment the recipes.
  i thought better have them all in for now so we can decide that later.

- all other objects like fins recipes need to be adjusted to use those plates.
