
-- pistol and rifle rack _icons
-- pistol and rifle rack smaler by 33-50% ? looks to large to me

-- pist and rifle rack recipe costs

-- FTL animation

-- tilesets: all _icons _DEFAULT and such unique/ stubs replaced ?

- Mining pod drill animation

- crew pistol and rifle rack object files

General

-- ftl thrusters and stabilizers don't use the jumping animation while jumping
-crew console (TODO: filter buttons and top left menue icon are stubs -> replace please)

Crew
- interacting obejcts
-- crew beamer
-- crew dismisser
-objects (new)
-- medical objects like surgery desk and monitors for a clinical themed room
-- marine objects (rifle racks for the wall, lockers, guardpost things) to make a marine styles room
-- resting state objects (so far we have all beds registered as rest objects) there could be other chill things
- attractors (existing vanilla objects names they would walk towards)
-- deckhand - where could they hang around ?
-- resting in general

- crew code:
-- heal task is broken due to new ROI handling
-- think about a way to do live target_position tracking with the current implementation -> pass target_entity ID to ROIState?
-- include A* pathfinding (jumper lib ?) at least to outrule locations that cant be reached at all on a birdview grid
-- test multiple NPCs task distribution
-- task communication based on sight instead of 50 blocks braodcast range
--- maybe also additional "auditory" bubble of a fixed radius as is now
-- get movement physics functions
--- jumping trajectory
--- player and npc exact collision box
-- some function i.e. from LS should be moved to madtulipLocation.lua instead
-- use grid dataformat from jumper instead of array[]{x,y} where possible
-- build grid for jumper function in madtulipLocation
