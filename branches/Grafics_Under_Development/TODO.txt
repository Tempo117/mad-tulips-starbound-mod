- icon in top left corner when openen ship station
- icons for the filters - that wooded chair just doesnt fit
- gravity tech chip doesnt unlock with tier1 as buildable
- replace the remaining button icons in shipstation folder with something usefull
- icons for the thermodynamics and captainsconsole are just dummies - replace please

- Metal press

-- upper left corner crafting menue icon needs to be created

*WIP* (could be better)
crafting menue icons for race or tiered platings may need to be changed eventually

*Wip* (looks like we may need convayor belt) (thinking about using pixel compressor texture variant)
there should be a ore displenser box on the left side and a plate containment on the right side.
the ore should fall out of the dispenser and the plate vanish in the containment so that no such
apearing or disappearing of ore and plate happens and it looks more liek a continious projess.
the whole press can wenn be 3 tims as broad for that as long as it looks smooth imo.

- cost for all platings need to be thought about
- maybe not all variants of the platings will be needed for now we can just uncomment the recipes.
  i thought better have them all in for now so we can decide that later.
- all other objects like fins recipes need to be adjusted to use those plates.

~ plates based off alloy's may bring up the question "will you make shipparts/ hull variants for them"
We may be able to get lazy for the tilesets but for the ship parts that may take much longer if we decide to make completly new ones.
