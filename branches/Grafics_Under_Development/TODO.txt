- Metal press
-- the foot of it beeing diagonal doesnt realy look well on the ground. so this needs adjustment
-- when it loops the ore just apears and the plate just vanishes
--- there should be a ore displenser box on the left side and a plate containment on the right side.
    the ore should fall out of the dispenser and the plate vanish in the containment so that no such
    apearing or disappearing of ore and plate happens and it looks more liek a continious projess.
    the whole press can wenn be 3 tims as broad for that as long as it looks smooth imo.

- costs for all platings need to be adjusted
- maybe not all variants of the platings will be needed for now we can just uncomment the recipes.
  i thought better have them all in for now so we can decide that later.
- all other objects like fins recipes need to be adjusted to use those plates.
