-------- Random things that need doing -----------
- All Tilesets _icon need to be updated. they still show the rusty pipe
- Glass Tileset
- Images for Ship Suit "\tech\skins\ShipSuit" and "\tech\skins\ShipSuit\suits" are just copies from vanilla. i.e. "AIR SUPPLY" needs to be removed. the brownish tone recolored, the tech icon be changed from O2 to something else.
- fix partly missing background behind tileset diagonals of starter ships
- please fix the forcefield door by using the grafic in ship parts\generic\forcefield door\OLD_madtulip_forcefield_door instead of the current apex door placeholder
- spawn and test all ship parts
- techstation needs "madtulip_techstation_lit.png" to be implemented (its a dummy should show non-powered version of it (see vanilla files))
- teleporters need _lit grafics as well (see vanilla teleporter) i added "madtulip_teleporter_lit" as placeholder to "ship parts\generic\teleporter" already.
- check if tier1 to tier5 recipe unlocking mechanic is working
- There seems to be a 1 Pixel glitch with the Tileset part South-East connecting with its East side to i.e. West-East 
- mining_pod_icon.png needs to be changed. looks like the scoutships
- scoutships throw an error with the "off" animation of the "engine" grafic. coundt find that one so far.
- test activateable ship objects like turrets

--------- Objects missing: -----------
- 1st weapon: avian
- 2nd weapon: avian, floran,hylotl
- Human SectorAirlock Door type
- Most Novakids stuff

----------- Things left to fix for madtulip ---------
-- check if content of pods (crafting tables) is still in line with the vanilla game progression. not that it allows to unlock a table at an earlier tier

-- upgrading the ship is overwriting its current layout. remove T0 to T8 ship progression from quests and .aicommands completly.

- fix defense turrets. vanilla turrets have been upgraded. should look into them.
- fix crew

- remove invulnerability on ship world option: world.setProperty("invinciblePlayers",false)

------------------- Ship progression quest thoughts -----------------
- use ship "capabilities" : ["teleport", "planetTravel", "systemTravel"], with normal questline instead of just giving them
-- need to find the points where we can hook in and replace *.aicommands and quests.
--- remove stats from initial ship strucutre files
--- givebeamaxe.aicommand or enableTeleporter.aicommand vanilla file has an example how to give those stats. so use that to create custom *.aicommands which unlock teleporter and the 2 other things
--- replace the original quest that unlock those abilities by our custom ones.
--- eventually the normal t0 to t8 ship progression will overwrite upgrades by constanty re appliing out empty t0 struct.
----> remove t0 to t8 upgrade process of all ships from the quest path.
-- working/none working version of the teleporter: use unlock of "enableTeleporter.aicommand" to spawn a working version of the teleporter? not sure how to do that.

- Space Physics
-- lua carrier as tech or better status effect
--- apply status effect: add permanent madtulips_shipmod statuseffect by some suitable source (i.e. "statusEffects" : ["madtulip_LS_suffocate"] in some object)
--- problem with statuseffect: probably cant accept controller input -> different handling of gravity.

-- life support - suffocate if no LS
--- madtulip_LS_suffocate permanently applies damage IF ON SHIPWORLD and is blocked by madtulip_immune_LS_suffocate
---- if on shipworld condition not readable -> workaround required -> create a general .lua for this function so we only need to replace it once.
--- madtulip_immune_LS_suffocate has a timer and runs out if not refreshed by LS system.
--- LS applies madtulip_immune_LS_suffocate by spawning a hidden projetile ontop of player if he is found in none breached area. see vanilla random status plant

-- die quickly in space
--- madtulip_space_death permanent status, cast by i.e. tech station
---- checks if on shipworld and outside ship(same as gravity tech). if true then loads of damage. canceled by madtulip_immune_space_death.
--- madtulip_immune_space_death status set by spacesuit armor

Bugreports:
- Crew doesnt spawn/is buggy for custom races -> check race to spawn against the original 6, if none of theese use human default
- Hyloti Scout Tech vehicle sound doesnt stop on exit vehicle. probably a starbound code bug
- MIAB:
I don't understand what just happened. I did everything like you did in your video, for modules in a box. I scanned an entire science laboratory, the scanner took all of it. and gave me nothing. I have no objects anywhere that let me re-print this building. How do I get a printing device to print this with? Where did it save the schematic to? :/
Also, level 4 BP "BP - Tier 4 Landing Pod" drops some items after it finished, even though I had flattened and cleaned all the land before printing. It drops: 35 Metal Object, 1 Ship Navigation Console, 47 Wall Panel, 8 Perfectly Generic Item, and a Pixel Printer.
I will verify this when I build another tomorrow. I'd still like to know what happened to my apex lab that I copied in full and how I'm supposed to build it.

Ideas:
- blacklist for .materials like wood that do not function as hull and produce breaches (or white list ?)
- destroy blacklisted blocks on warp
- no warp on hullbreach
- other conditions for warp
- spacesuit with zero gravity attached to its chest item including a jetpack which is faster then zero gravity movement.
- automated harvest drones for wood and metal (digging to the metal and then mining it, bringing it back to some container) -> starfoundry

Crew (mid to low priority)
- 2 to 3 resting objects like fridges ? and the like
- deckhand - where could they hang around ? normal resting state objects?
- recipes for some vanilla items that would make good work attractor items like medical tank ?

Beds sleepable: (needs additional grafic, see original beds)
{"item" : "madtulip_crew_wall_mounted_bed"},
{"item" : "madtulip_medical_bed"},
{"item" : "madtulip_medical_bed"},
{"item" : "madtulip_medical_surgery_bed"},

Crew

- crew beamer 1-hand item: needs icon (handheld scotty beam me up teleporting device ? (low priority)
- crew dismisser 1-hand item: makes crew disappear/die - idea? (low priority)

- mannequin -> spacesuit
- mannequin -> military outfit

-Crew
-- hull breach: LS needs to update the Task if new breaches are added to the clusters
-- hull breach: NPC should also be able to reach higher jump locations
-- hull breach: instead of placing all blocks at the same time we could animate that nicer (one at a time with a beamaxe i.e.)
-- 
-- heal task is broken due to new ROI handling
-- think about a way to do live target_position tracking with the current implementation -> pass target_entity ID to ROIState?
-- test multiple NPCs task distribution
-- task communication based on sight instead of 50 blocks braodcast range
--- maybe also additional "auditory" bubble of a fixed radius as is now
-- floodfill breach cluster interior -> additional breache locations so that larger breaches are not "outlined" by foreground walls but filled with background instead

-- include A* pathfinding (jumper lib ?) at least to outrule locations that cant be reached at all on a birdview grid
-- get movement physics functions
--- jumping trajectory
--- player and npc exact collision box
-- some function i.e. from LS should be moved to madtulipLocation.lua instead
