General

Ship Station
- icon in top left corner when opening ship station
- icons for the filters ( one or two left )
- replace the remaining button icons in shipstation folder with something useful

Metal press
-- upper left corner crafting menu icon needs to be created

- cost for all platings need to be thought about
~ instead of the coal in the heavy steel plating and the heavy durrasteel plating silver and gold ore should be used.

- maybe not all variants of the platings will be needed for now we can just uncomment the recipes.
  i thought better have them all in for now so we can decide that later.

- all other objects like fins recipes need to be adjusted to use those plates.

~ plates based off alloy's may bring up the question "will you make shipparts/ hull variants for them"
We may be able to get lazy for the tilesets but for the ship parts that may take much longer if we decide to make completely new ones.

*WIP* Pretty much done with crafting menu icons for metal press (may need to be changed eventually)

*WIP* Metal press good for now ( later I will add conveyor belt based off pixel compressor)
