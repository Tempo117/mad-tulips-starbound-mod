-------- Bugs -----------
- please fix the forcefield door \!TODO\Objects\forcefield door (copy the "OLD..." grafic into the current working dummy png)
- There seems to be a 1 Pixel glitch with the Tileset part South-East connecting with its East side to i.e. West-East 

-------- Grafics required -----------
- mining_pod_icon.png needs to be changed. looks like the scoutships
- images for unlockers - put small grafic over each blueprint? \madtulip\items\unlockers

--------- Objects missing: -----------
- 1st ship weapon for avian
- 2nd ship weapon for avian, floran and hylotl
- Human SectorAirlock Door type (copy paste from another race)
- Most Novakid objects

----------- Things left to fix for madtulip ---------
- create "novakid" filter in the shipstation
- fix status monitor
- recipe unlocking and progression mechanics
- fix crew
- reactivate on/off toggle of life support once ship suit can detect that states

----------- Ship progression quest thoughts ---------
- replace the original quest/ai missions that deal with ship repair and intregrate out own

----------- Space Physics -------------
-- accelerate floating while wearing space suit (jetpack)
-- damage by missing LS
--- run LS code on player suit tech to detect if hes in a breached area -> set a stat which is prevented by equipping the spacesuit

----------- Races ----------- 
-Need support for more custom races such as the kineptic one

Bugreports:
- Crew doesnt spawn/is buggy for custom races -> check race to spawn against the original 6, if none of theese use human default
- Hyloti Scout Tech vehicle sound doesnt stop on exit vehicle. probably a starbound code bug
- MIAB:
I don't understand what just happened. I did everything like you did in your video, for modules in a box. I scanned an entire science laboratory, the scanner took all of it. and gave me nothing. I have no objects anywhere that let me re-print this building. How do I get a printing device to print this with? Where did it save the schematic to? :/
Also, level 4 BP "BP - Tier 4 Landing Pod" drops some items after it finished, even though I had flattened and cleaned all the land before printing. It drops: 35 Metal Object, 1 Ship Navigation Console, 47 Wall Panel, 8 Perfectly Generic Item, and a Pixel Printer.
I will verify this when I build another tomorrow. I'd still like to know what happened to my apex lab that I copied in full and how I'm supposed to build it.

Ideas:
- blacklist for .materials like wood that do not function as hull and produce breaches (or white list ?)
- destroy blacklisted blocks on warp
- no warp on hullbreach
- other conditions for warp
- spacesuit with zero gravity attached to its chest item including a jetpack which is faster then zero gravity movement.
- automated harvest drones for wood and metal (digging to the metal and then mining it, bringing it back to some container) -> starfoundry

Crew (mid to low priority)
- 2 to 3 resting objects like fridges ? and the like
- deckhand - where could they hang around ? normal resting state objects?
- recipes for some vanilla items that would make good work attractor items like medical tank ?

Beds sleepable: (needs additional grafic, see original beds)
{"item" : "madtulip_crew_wall_mounted_bed"},
{"item" : "madtulip_medical_bed"},
{"item" : "madtulip_medical_bed"},
{"item" : "madtulip_medical_surgery_bed"},

Crew

- crew beamer 1-hand item: needs icon (handheld scotty beam me up teleporting device ? (low priority)
- crew dismisser 1-hand item: makes crew disappear/die - idea? (low priority)

- mannequin -> spacesuit
- mannequin -> military outfit

-Crew
-- hull breach: LS needs to update the Task if new breaches are added to the clusters
-- hull breach: NPC should also be able to reach higher jump locations
-- hull breach: instead of placing all blocks at the same time we could animate that nicer (one at a time with a beamaxe i.e.)
-- 
-- heal task is broken due to new ROI handling
-- think about a way to do live target_position tracking with the current implementation -> pass target_entity ID to ROIState?
-- test multiple NPCs task distribution
-- task communication based on sight instead of 50 blocks braodcast range
--- maybe also additional "auditory" bubble of a fixed radius as is now
-- floodfill breach cluster interior -> additional breache locations so that larger breaches are not "outlined" by foreground walls but filled with background instead

-- include A* pathfinding (jumper lib ?) at least to outrule locations that cant be reached at all on a birdview grid
-- get movement physics functions
--- jumping trajectory
--- player and npc exact collision box
-- some function i.e. from LS should be moved to madtulipLocation.lua instead
