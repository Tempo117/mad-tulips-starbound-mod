Madtulip, I Proudly present My verry on branch of your mod not just a forkk

I mean no offence by this ~~ I Just Needed a squeaky clean start ~~

Right now its just a sandbox for me to experiment with stuff so I dont have to clutter your dev environment

Im also planning on mod compat 
 * Not necisarally just race mod tilesets, objects too ~<3
 * Ise-3 compat (mostly just optional recipes)
 * Anything else i think may not exactly belong in the base mod
